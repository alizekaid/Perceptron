# PERCEPTRON

A perceptron is a fundamental unit in artificial neural networks. It takes inputs, multiplies
them by weights, applies an activation function, and produces an output based on a threshold.
Perceptrons are used for simple linear classification tasks and serve as the building blocks for
more complex neural network architectures.

In this work, I delved into the fundamentals of the Perceptron and the Backpropagation
algorithm, which are foundational concepts in the field of artificial neural networks.
These concepts play a crucial role in the development and training of neural networks, enabling
them to learn and make predictions from data. While making this project, I applied basic concepts of programming such as function conditionals and loops
on a perceptron backpropagation algorithm based on calculus.
